-- | AST for the desugared, untyped core language.
data Core where

  -- | A variable.
  CVar  :: Name Core -> Core

  -- | A constructor, identified by number, with arguments.  For
  --   example, false and true are represented by @CCons 0 []@ and
  --   @CCons 1 []@, respectively; a pair is represented by @CCons 0
  --   [c1, c2]@.  Note we do not need to remember which type the
  --   constructor came from; if the program typechecked then we will
  --   never end up comparing constructors from different types.
  CCons :: Int -> [Core] -> Core

  -- | A rational number.
  CNum  :: Rational -> Core

  -- | An anonymous function.
  CAbs  :: Bind (Name Core) Core -> Core

  -- | Function application, with a strictness annotation.  The
  --   strictness is determined by the type of the application (which
  --   has been erased), and determines whether the argument should be
  --   evaluated before applying the function.
  CApp  :: Strictness -> Core -> Core -> Core

  -- | Operator application, with a list of arguments.  Note there is
  --   no longer any distinction between unary and binary operators.
  --   Assuming this was correctly desugared from a successfully
  --   parsed and typechecked program, operators will always have the
  --   correct number of arguments.
  COp   :: Op -> [Core] -> Core

  -- | Non-recursive let @let x = t1 in t2@, with a strictness
  --   annotation to determine whether @t1@ should be evaluated before
  --   evaluating @t2@.
  CLet  :: Strictness -> Bind (Name Core, Embed Core) Core -> Core

  -- | A case expression.
  CCase :: [CBranch] -> Core

  deriving Show

-- | Operators that can show up in the core language.  Note that not

        | OGcd     -- ^ Greatest common divisor (@gcd@)
        | OEq Type -- ^ Equality test (@==@) at the given type.  At
                   --   this point, typechecking has determined that
                   --   the given type has decidable equality.  We
                   --   need to know the type in order to perform the
                   --   equality test.
        | OLt Type -- ^ Less than (@<@).  Similarly, typechecking has
                   --   determined that the given type has a decidable
                   --   ordering relation.

type CBranch = Bind CGuards Core

-- | A list of guards.

  CGEmpty :: CGuards

  -- | A single guard followed by a list of guards.  Note there is
  --   only one kind of guard in the core language, corresponding to
  --   pattern guards (@when@) in the surface language.  Boolean
  --   (@if@) guards are desugared to pattern matching on @true@.
  CGCons  :: Rebind (Embed Core, CPattern) CGuards -> CGuards
  deriving Show

-- | Core (desugared) patterns.  We only need variables, wildcards,
--   natural numbers, and constructors.
data CPattern where

  -- | A variable pattern, which matches anything and binds the name.
  CPVar  :: Name Core -> CPattern

  -- | A wildcard pattern @_@, which matches anything.
  CPWild :: CPattern

  -- | A cons-pattern.  @CPCons i pats@ matches @CCons j tms@ if @i ==
